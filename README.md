# burger_NodeExpressHandlebars

Coding Bootcamp Homework Assignment #12

In this assignment we are creating a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a ORM.

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input names of burgers they'd like to eat.  Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page.

While each burger is in the waiting area, there is a Devour It! button.  When the user clicks, the burger 
will move to the right side of the page.
The app should store every burger in a MySQL databse, whether the devour button is clicked or not.
